### `asin`
#### Melanie R. Kazenel

The `asin` function computes the arc-sine of a numeric or complex vector, which is the input. The input should be in radians, not degrees. The output is the arc-sine value of each number in the vector.  

```{r}
# Compute the arc-sine of a single number
asin(1)

# Compute the arc-sine of each number in a vector
z <- c(0.5,0.75,1) # create a vector
asin(z) # compute the arcsine of each element
```
